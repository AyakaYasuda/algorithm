<< linked lists >>
- Linked lists are a loose data structure, so you can insert a value in the middle of the list
- To access to a particular item, you need to traverse items until you get to it: iteration - O(n)
- Items will be scattered all over the memory
- Iterating through items in liked lists are a bit slower than iterating items in arrays
- Inserting an item in the middle of the linked list is better than inserting into arrays

prepend: O(1)
append: O(1)
lookup: O(n)
insert: O(n)
delete: O(n)

<< arrays >>
- When inserting an item in the array, the array needs to shift all items and indexes down, which costs us O(n)
- If you want to access a particular item, it's easy because it has an index
- Array items are always located right next each other in the memory

<< hash maps >>
- The easiest way to insert Items or delete items
- No order
