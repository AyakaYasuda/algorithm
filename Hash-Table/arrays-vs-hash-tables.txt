arrays
- searching/inserting something takes long time
- keys are always 0, 1, 2, 3...
- data will be placed next each other


hash tables
- you can search/insert something really fast
- hash tables can tack flexible keys
- no concept of order: data could be placed all over the place
- slow key iteration
