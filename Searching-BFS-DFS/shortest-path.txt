if you want to find the shortest path, let's say you're using google map, you can use Dijkstra or Bellman Ford algorithm bc they matters the weight of each edge.
- Bellman Ford algorithm can accommodate negative weights.
- However, Bellman Ford algorithm's time complexity can be O(n^2) in the worst case.
- Dijkstra algorithm is faster than Bellman algorithm.
