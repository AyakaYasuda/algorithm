Bubble sort
- you're never going to use bubble sort

Insertion sort
- should be used with small input or mostly sorted data, then it will be really fast

Selection sort
- you're never going to use bubble sort

Merge sort
- it's always O(n log n) so it's relatively fast
- it's divided up evenly
- in terms of space complexity, it'll be very expensive // O(n) -> sorting outside of memory would be best

Quick sort
- looks like better than merge sort but you need to be careful about the worst case
