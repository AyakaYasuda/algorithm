/*

Stacks
- LIFO: you can think of them as plates piling up -> you can only touch the last plate
- lookup -> O(n)
- pop -> O(1)
- push -> O(1)
- peek -> O(1)

Queues
- FIFO: you can think of them as people lining up for a roller coaster
- lookup -> O(n)
- enqueue -> O(1)
- dequeue -> O(1)
- peek -> O(1)
- you don't want to use an array

// << Stacks >>
// ex. browser history
// google -> udemy -> facebook -> twitter
// you can build stacks with arrays or linked lists pretty well

// << Queues >>
// ex. waiting list
// Mike <- Joy <- Emma <- Kate
// Head                   Tail pointer
// you can build stacks with arrays or linked lists but using linked lists is a good idea
