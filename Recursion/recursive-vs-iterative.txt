- Anything you do with a recursion can be done iteratively.

pros
- Recursion can keep your code dry and simpler.

cons
- Recursion makes extra function calls that take up stack space.
- Time Complexity is large.

when to use recursion
- Every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree, consider recursion.
1. Divided into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Each instance of the subproblem is identical in nature.
3. The solutions of each subproblem can be combined to solve the problem at hand.

- Divide and conquer using recursion
